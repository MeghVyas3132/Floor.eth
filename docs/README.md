# Floor docs

Floor is a lender-side, effective-state security rating for collateral assets, with bounded enforcement.
It answers one question continuously: **"Who or what can create or release this collateral right now, and how many independent parties must agree?"**

Everything here is cited. If a statement has no source, it is marked **ESTIMATE**, **HYPOTHESIS** or **UNVERIFIED**. Read [00-evidence-policy.md](00-evidence-policy.md) before adding anything.

Last full evidence audit: 2026-11-06 (primary sources + onchain reads). Docs reconciled with the live deployment: 2026-11-07. Live site: https://floor.aexiz.in.
